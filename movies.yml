  title: The Godfather
  director: Francis Ford Coppola
  year: '1972'
  describe: An everyday story of Mafia folk, incorporating a severed horse's head
    in the bed and a number of heartwarming family occasions, as well as pointers
    on how not to behave in your local trattoria (i.e. blasting the brains of your
    co-diners out all over their fettuccini).Mario Puzo's novel was brought to the
    screen in bravura style by Coppola, who was here trying out for the first time
    that piano/fortissimo style of crosscutting between religious ritual and bloody
    machine-gun massacre that was later to resurface in a watered-down version in
    The Cotton Club. See Brando with a mouthful of orange peel. Watch Pacino's cheek
    muscles twitch in incipiently psychotic fashion. Trace his rise from white sheep
    of the family to budding don and fully-fledged bad guy. Singalong to Nino Rota's
    irritatingly catchy theme tune. Its soap operatics should never have been presented
    separately from Part II.

  title: In the Mood for Love
  director: Wong Kar-wai
  year: '2000'
  describe: Wong's paean to the agony'n ecstasy of buttoned-up emotions is a kind-of
    sequel to Days of Being Wild, shaped and scored as a valse triste. In Hong Kong,
    1962, Mr Chow (Leung) and Mrs Chan (Cheung) are neighbours who discover that their
    spouses are having an affair. He finds excuses to spend time with her, apparently
    intending to jilt her. Then they fall in love, but (aside from one reckless moment
    in a hotel) repress their feelings. He runs away to work as a journalist in Singapore;
    in 1966, covering De Gaulle's state visit to Cambodia, he's in Angkor Wat trying
    to unburden himself of the secret which overwhelms his life... Every charged frame
    of the film pulses with the central contradiction between repression and emotional
    abandon; the formalism and sensuality are inextricable. Career-best performances
    from both leads, Leung having a Cannes 'Best Actor' prize to show for his.
